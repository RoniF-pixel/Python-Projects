## Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project uses data from 129,880 airline passengers to build a model that predicts customer satisfaction based on feedback about various flight experience factors — including flight class, distance, seat comfort, and in-flight entertainment.

## Objective

The goal is to help the airline determine whether improving in-flight entertainment leads to higher customer satisfaction, and to build a predictive model for future customer responses based on similar features.

## Key Findings

- Customers who rated in-flight entertainment highly were significantly more likely to be satisfied.

- A logistic regression model using only the "in-flight entertainment" score achieved:

    - **Accuracy**: 80.2%

    - **Precision**: 81.6%

    - **Recall**: 82.2%

    - **F1 Score**: 81.9%

- This is a substantial improvement over the dataset’s baseline satisfaction rate of 54.7%.

## Recommendation

The results suggest that improving in-flight entertainment is likely to increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, the airline should consider developing more advanced models by incorporating multiple variables to gain deeper insights and more accurate predictions.
